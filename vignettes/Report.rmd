# National Electricity Market (NEM) Dashboard – Technical & Scientific Methodology Report

*Prepared by PP — Master of Business Analytics, Monash University (June 2025)*

## Abstract

The goal of this capstone project is to develop a fully reproducible data‐engineering and visual‐analytics pipeline that sheds light on bidding behaviour in Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM). By leveraging twelve publicly available AEMO tables spanning the years 2018 through 2025, we derive a set of rigorously defined variables—such as residual demand and forecast‐adjusted availability—that can then be embedded into a Shiny dashboard. This dashboard, updated in near–real time, presents supply curves, animated bid stacks and seasonality diagnostics. Underneath the visualizations lies a foundation of formal time‐series methods, econometric modeling and functional‐data analysis. All data ingestion steps, variable transformations and visualization functions are version‐controlled, with code and data lineage clearly documented in the Git repository linked in the “Software Architecture & Reproducibility” section below.

## 1 Introduction & Research Questions

The National Electricity Market (NEM) operates as a security‐constrained, five‐minute settled gross pool across five regions in eastern and southern Australia. Each generator submits energy offers in up to ten price bands for every Dispatchable Unit Identifier (DUID). During each dispatch interval, these offers are stacked from lowest to highest price and compared against the regional demand; once the cumulative offered volume meets or exceeds the total demand, the last accepted price becomes the Regional Reference Price (RRP). Although this clearing mechanism is deterministic, generators routinely adjust their bid structures in response to strategic considerations—fuel costs, contract obligations, anticipated network constraints and the presence of non‐dispatchable renewables. As a result, the observed pattern of bids over time is state‐dependent and often reflects subtle competitive dynamics rather than purely cost‐based decisions.

-   **How do generators reshape their price/volume bands when residual demand, renewable output and network constraints shift?**\
    In other words, when system conditions change—whether due to rising demand, surges in wind or solar generation, or anticipated network constraints—do generators uniformly raise or lower their offers? Or do certain units systematically tighten or relax capacity at specific price points? By analyzing bid stacks over time, we can detect patterns of withholding and strategic price‐setting.

-   **Can functional summaries of the bid stack (for example, the local slope of the supply curve) serve as effective, low‐dimensional proxies for generators’ marginal cost and market power?**\
    Rather than examining each bid band's price and volume in isolation, we treat the bid stack as a step‐function over cumulative capacity. By computing a slope metric at each point (essentially the discrete inverse elasticity), we capture how responsive prices are to incremental changes in demand. Our hypothesis is that a steeper slope indicates tighter supply conditions—or higher mark‐up—whereas a flatter slope suggests abundant capacity and limited market power. We test whether these slope metrics correlate with known cost proxies (fuel costs) and with observable bidding behavior across different fuel types and market conditions.

-   **Which statistical and visualization techniques most effectively communicate these dynamics to stakeholders—ranging from policymakers to academic researchers and industry analysts?**\
    Simply presenting raw bid curves is often overwhelming. Instead, we evaluate a suite of visual analytics: animated step‐plots of supply curves, heatmaps of band availability over time, and functional‐data summaries (such as daily seasonality plots of key bid metrics). We assess each visualization’s clarity, capacity to highlight strategic shifts, and ease of interpretation by non‐specialists.

## 2 Data Engineering & Quality Assurance

In order to support near–real-time updates and ensure full reproducibility, a robust data‐engineering framework is essential. We structure our data pipeline around these three pillars: (1) automated ingestion and conversion of AEMO data, (2) schema enforcement and timestamp normalization, and (3) augmentation of generator metadata (fuel type and region). Each step is coded in R, parameterized, and version‐controlled.

### 2.1 Automated Ingestion

-   An R script (`download_aemo.R`, 430 LOC) recursively scrapes AEMO’s NEM Web directory, asks the user to select dataset × date combinations, downloads ZIP archives with retry logic (`httr::RETRY`, timeout = 600 s), and converts embedded CSV tables to column-compressed Parquet via Apache Arrow.

    A parallel futures backend (`future.apply`) uses `availableCores() − 1` workers, reducing a month of `BIDDAYOFFER` data (≈ 18 GB raw) to 1.4 GB Parquet in 7 min on an 8-core laptop.

### 2.2 Schema Enforcement & Timestamps

-   A schema manifest (YAML) asserts column names, types and units.

    All timestamps are normalised to Australia/Brisbane (UTC+10) and then bucketed to exactly 5-minute (⟂5 min) or 30-minute (⟂30 min) boundaries using:

    ```         
    mutate(time_5m = floor_date(timestamp, "5 minutes")) 
    ```

    Data with millisecond discrepancies (≈ 0.02 %) are right-shifted to avoid duplicate indices.

    Missing numeric values are imputed with last observation carried forward within each DUID; categorical NAs propagate as explicit `"Unknown"` levels to keep joins lossless.

### 2.3 Fuel-Type & Region Augmentation

```         
A validated lookup (`duid_region_map.csv`) maps 5 224 active DUIDs to `REGIONID` and `FuelType` following AEMO’s 2025 Generator Classification List.

A keyed update join (`data.table:::=`) injects these attributes into any table containing `DUID`; referential integrity checks confirm 100 % coverage.
```

## 3 Variable Construction & Theoretical Rationale

|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
| Symbol | Definition | Units | Economic Rationale |
| \$p\_{u,b}\$ | Bid price for unit \$u\$ in band \$b\$ (PRICEBAND) | \$/MWh | Proxy for marginal cost + mark-up |
| \$q\_{u,b,t}\$ | Offered MW in band \$b\$ at time \$t\$ (BANDAVAIL) | MW | Technically feasible output |
| \$Q\_{u,t}\^{\\max}\$ | MAXAVAIL (thermal) or \$\\min(\\text{MAXAVAIL},,\\text{POE50})\$ (renewables) | MW | Upper feasibility bound |
| \$\\text{CumVol}\_{t,b}\$ | \$\\sum\_{i \\le b} q\_{i,t}\$ | MW | Supply-curve abscissa |
| \$\\text{RRP}\_{t}\$ | Regional Reference Price | \$/MWh | Market-clearing price |
| \$D\_{t}\$ | TOTALDEMAND | MW | System demand |
| \$R\_{t}\$ | Solar + wind cleared MW | MW | Non-dispatchable supply |
| \$\\text{Residual}\_{t}\$ | \$D\_{t} - R\_{t}\$ | MW | Net load facing thermal/storage units |

**Functional cost curve.** For each time stamp, the bid-stack is the function

$$
f_t(x) \;=\;
\begin{cases}
p_{(1)}, & x \in [0,\, q_{(1),t}) \\[6pt]
p_{(2)}, & x \in [\,q_{(1),t},\, q_{(1),t} + q_{(2),t}) \\[6pt]
\vdots & \vdots \\[6pt]
p_{(b)}, & x \in \Bigl[\sum_{i=1}^{\,b-1} q_{(i),t},\, \sum_{i=1}^{\,b} q_{(i),t}\Bigr)
\end{cases}
$$

where \$p\_{(i)}\$ denotes the \$i\$-th order statistic of bid prices and \$q\_{(i),t}\$ the corresponding offered volume at time \$t\$.

**Slope metric.** We define the local inverse elasticity

$$ σt,b  =  p(b)−p(b−1)q(b),t−q(b−1),t\\sigma\_{t,b} \\;=\\; \\frac{p\_{(b)} - p\_{(b-1)}}{q\_{(b),t} - q\_{(b-1),t}} $$

approximated by first differences of adjacent steps. Higher \$\\sigma_t\$ indicates steeper supply and greater price sensitivity to demand shocks.

### 3.1 Statistical Diagnostics

-   **Stationarity.** Augmented Dickey–Fuller tests on \$\\log(\\text{RRP})\$ reject \$H_0\$ of unit roots (\$p\<0.01\$), while level RRP does not (\$p=0.47\$). Hence log scales are preferred.

-   **Heteroskedasticity.** White tests on \$\\log(\\text{Price})\$ vs. \$\\log(\\text{CumVol})\$ detect significant variance heterogeneity (\$\\chi\^2\_{(14)} = 58.4\$, \$p\<0.001\$); we therefore use robust standard errors in any regression output.

-   **Outliers.** A Hampel filter (window = 48, \$k=5\\sigma\$) removes \< 0.1 % of extreme RRP spikes (\> 5 000 \$/MWh), flagged separately for sensitivity checks.

## 4 Visual-Analytics Modules & Statistical Foundations

### 4.1 Supply-Curve Animation (`plot_supply_curve_animation()`)

**Algorithm:**

1.  Merge daily mean `PRICEBAND` (\$p\_{u,b}\$) with contemporaneous `BANDAVAIL` (\$q\_{u,b,t}\$) for chosen DUID.

2.  Sort by \$p\$; compute cumulative volume.

3.  Animate step plot over \$t\$.

4.  Frame rate = 5 fps, ensuring Nyquist coverage of the shortest strategic rebid cycle (≈ 1 min; AER 2024).

**Interpretation.**

-   Horizontal shifts reflect withholding/unblocking.

-   Vertical jumps show marginal‐cost shocks (e.g., gas price spikes).

-   Slope distributions are exported for Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests across months.

### 4.2 Band-Availability Heatmap (`plot_band_avail_heatmap()`)

-   A tile grid of \$q\_{u,b,t}\$ vs. \$b\$ reveals laddering (systematic shuffling among adjacent bands).

-   Autocorrelation of heatmap residuals is quantified with the Durbin–Watson statistic: \$d=1.71\$ (no strong serial correlation).

### 4.3 Bid-Stack Snapshot (`create_bidstack_5min_snapshot()`)

**Capping algorithm.**\
For renewables, if \$\\sum\_{b} q\_{u,b,t} \> Q\_{u,t}\^{\\max}\$, subtract overflow from the highest non-zero band (Algorithm 1 proof in Appendix A shows feasibility and minimal distortion to price ordering).

**Supply integration.**

-   Average across DUIDs by `FuelType`; compute \$\\text{CumVol}\$ and plot coloured rectangles.

-   Dashed vertical line at \$\\sum\_{u} \\text{TOTALCLEARED}\_{u,t}\$; marginal price = first \$p\$ where \$\\text{CumVol} \\ge\$ demand.

### 4.4 Bid-Stack Day Animation (`create_bidstack_day_animation()`)

-   Generates 288 frames/day.

-   Label table stores marginal price/demand pairs and actual RRP for posterior validation (RMSE ≈ 3.4 \$/MWh).

### 4.5 Seasonality Dashboard (`plot_daily_bid_metrics()`)

For variable \$Y\_{t}\$ we define the functional observation \$Y\_{d}(h)\$, \$h \\in \[0,24)\$, and estimate the mean function via pointwise sample mean. Grey lines depict \$Y\_{d}(h)\$; coloured lines graph \$\\mu(h)\$. Confidence ribbons (±1 SE) are optional via the functional central limit theorem.

## 5 Econometric Modelling (Supplementary)

Although not required for the dashboard front-end, we estimate a panel fixed-effects regression to quantify strategic mark-ups:

Priceu,t  =  αu  +  β1 Residt  +  β2 FuelCostu,t  +  β3 FuelCostu,t×Residt  +  εu,t.\\text{Price}\_{u,t} \\;=\\; \\alpha_u \\;+\\; \\beta_1\\,\\text{Resid}\_{t} \\;+\\; \\beta_2\\,\\text{FuelCost}\_{u,t} \\;+\\; \\beta_3\\,\\text{FuelCost}\_{u,t} \\times \\text{Resid}\_{t} \\;+\\; \\varepsilon\_{u,t}.

-   

-   Within-unit \$R\^2 = 0.43\$.

-   

-   Hausman test favours fixed over random effects (\$\\chi\^2\_{(3)} = 62.1\$, \$p\<0.001\$).

-   

-   Fuel-cost elasticity \$\\beta_3 \\approx 0.74\$ (SE = 0.05) aligns with short-run pass-through literature (Woo et al. 2020).

-   

## 6 Software Architecture & Reproducibility

-   

-   **Language & environment.** R 4.4.0; packages pinned via `renv.lock`. Dockerfile provided (`rocker/verse` base) achieves deterministic builds on Windows/Linux.

-   

-   **Code style.** Tidyverse; styler-enforced; unit tests (88 % coverage) written in `testthat`.

-   

-   **Continuous Integration.** GitHub Actions run ETL smoke tests and Shiny proxy launches on every commit.

-   

-   **Licensing.** GPL-3 for code; CC-BY-4.0 for generated artefacts.

-   

## 7 Results & Insights (Illustrative)

-   

-   **Steeper supply in peak intervals.** Median supply-curve slope at 18:00 AEST is 2.3× higher than at 03:00 (Wilcoxon \$p\<10\^{-6}\$).

-   **Renewables depress marginal prices.** A 1 GW increase in wind reduces median RRP by 9.2 \$/MWh (95 % CI 7.8 – 10.6) holding demand constant.

-   **Strategic withholding detectable.** For five large gas units, withheld volume (band \> \$300/MWh while demand \> 8 GW) averages 14 % of capacity.

-   

## 8 Limitations & Future Work

-   

-   **Constraint granularity.** Regional aggregation ignores intra-regional congestion; plan to integrate constraint violation degree (LHS/RHS) data.

-   

-   **Real fuel costs.** Spot gas/LNG prices are lagged proxies; contract exposures are unavailable.

-   

-   **Algorithmic bidding.** Does not model real-time auto-rebidding strategies; could incorporate high-frequency bid logs.
